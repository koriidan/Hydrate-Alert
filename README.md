CODING CHALLENGE FROM EOG RESOURCES

Keynotes: Before running please run proper library downloads for matplotlib and streamlit    

Hydrate Alert is a web application designed to monitor gas injection systems in real-time and detect potential hydrate formation, which can lead to system failures or pipeline blockages. The app processes time-series data uploaded by users in CSV format, visualizes trends in gas volume and valve settings, and alerts operators when significant volume drops occurâ€”indicating a potential hydrate risk.    

Features:
Real-Time Data Visualization: Upload CSV files and visualize gas injection trends over time with interactive graphs.    
Hydrate Detection: Automatically detect potential hydrate formation based on sudden volume drops and trigger alerts.    
Dynamic Data Updates: Watch the data being plotted live as the system processes each line of the CSV file.    
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface built using Streamlit, allowing for easy file upload and real-time analysis.    

Technologies Used:    
Python: Main programming language for backend data processing and analysis.    
Streamlit: Framework for building the interactive web application.
